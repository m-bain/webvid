Large-scale text-video dataset, **containing 10 million video-text pairs** scraped from the web. This dataset was used for large-scale pretraining to achieve state-of-the-art end-to-end retrieval in our frozen-in-time work: the code of which can be found [here](https://github.com/m-bain/frozen-in-time)

2.5M Subset

- [train](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~maxbain/webvid/results_2M_train.csv) (640MB) `wget http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~maxbain/webvid/results_2M_train.csv`
- [val](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~maxbain/webvid/results_2M_val.csv) (1.3MB) `wget http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~maxbain/webvid/results_2M_val.csv`


10M

- [train](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~maxbain/webvid/results_10M_train.csv) (2.7GB)`wget http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~maxbain/webvid/results_10M_train.csv`
- [val](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~maxbain/webvid/results_10M_val.csv) (1.3MB) `wget http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~maxbain/webvid/results_10M_val.csv`

## Download videos

1. Download csv file(s) above to this repository
2. `pip install pandas numpy requests mpi4py`
3. To download on one job: `python download.py --csv_path results_2M_train.csv --partitions 1 --part 0 --data_dir ./data --processes 8`. You can split this across N concurrent jobs by choosing `--partitions N` partitions and running each job with different `--part $idx`. You can also specify the number of processes, recommended one per cpu.

There might be more efficient ways download the videos than this script, e.g. by modifying https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset to download videos instead of images.

## FAQs

**Q1**: Can you provide the original videos for download?

**A1**: Since we do not own the videos in the dataset, we cannot legally provide them to you. The video owner(s) can choose to delete it at anytime, in which case the video will no longer be available in the dataset. Due to this, unfortunately, some videos in the dataset will be lost over time, and we are unable to help with this issue. However, the sources are official and we expect the large majority of videos to be available for the forseeable future.
###

**Q2**: Is it normal that a subset of videos cannot be retrieved from the provided URLs?

**A2**: Yes. See Q1.

###

**Q3**: I noticed there are watermarks on the videos, how will this affect training?

**A3**: We found we were still able to achieve top performance (with the watermarks) on downstream text-to-video retrieval, both for finetuning and zero-shot settings. We expect similar results on other video language tasks but didn't test these in the paper. If you do use this dataset for other video-language tasks, we'd be interested to hear how it goes.

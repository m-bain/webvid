You must not use the content in the WebVid dataset if you do not agree to these terms.

**What does content mean?**

We mean the WebVid video urls and captions which are curated by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG), and which we are making available to you to download from a link provided by the University hosting and managing the content (or in any other way we decide). We do not guarantee that the link or content will always be available, or that it is accurate, free of viruses and bugs, or the information in it can be relied upon. You use the content entirely at your own risk.

**What can I use it for?**

Provided you keep to these rules, the University grants you (the researcher) a non-exclusive and non-transferable licence to use the content free of charge strictly for non-commercial research (i.e., whose output artefacts are not incorporated in commercial products) for 12 months. You are responsible for your own costs in using the content. You must delete the content when this permission ends. You may download the content again, and renew the licence, if it is still available.

You must not:
- use the content other than for the Permitted Purpose in strict conformity with these terms and any other reasonable instructions of the University.
- except as may be strictly necessary for carrying out the Permitted Purpose, provide or otherwise make available content to any third party or allow use of it or them by or on behalf of any third party, in whole or in part, whether by way of sale, resale, loan, transfer, hire or any other form of exploitation; or
- attempt to identify any living or deceased individual from the content.

You shall:
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in relation to the use of the content, including without limitation the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK GDPR; and
- not participate or encourage the participation in any illegal, deceptive, misleading or unethical practice, including, but without limitation, disparagement of the content or any other practices which may be detrimental to the same or the University.

You shall notify the University promptly of:
- any inaccuracies, errors or malfunctions in the content which come (or should reasonably come) to its attention.
- any unlicensed or other unauthorised use of the whole or any part of any of the content which comes to (or should reasonably come to) your attention; and
- any allegation by any person that the use of the whole or any part of any of our site infringes the rights of any third party.

All rights not expressly granted to you under these terms are reserved to the University and/or its third-party licensors, and you shall make no use of the content except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. You shall permit the University to take such steps as the University reasonably considers appropriate to monitor compliance with the terms of this Agreement and shall co-operate fully with the University in relation to such monitoring.
